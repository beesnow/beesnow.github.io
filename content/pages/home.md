Bee Snow is currently a graduate student and TA at Indiana State University, graduating in the Fall of 2026. She works in many different media to visually contrast and combine the seen and unseen. Mental space isn't always clearly shown in body language, facial expressions, or words. Neuro-divergency can be loud like bright graffiti, exaggerated size, and repeating patterns, or confusing... shown with visual communications like sign language, morse code, emojis and symbols.  Bee's art contrasts black and white figurative elements and every day objects punctured with dots, holes and organic edges. All these are framed, unframed, art surrounding the frame... Art on on the frame: demonstrating how neuro-divergent people are more than inside or outside "the box", paper, canvas, pot or frame.  She pits the grittiness of "real life" and the chaos of ADHD against the peacefulness of alone time and the abstractness of different mental landscapes. Believable, normal, calm, acceptable: neurodivergence has become front, center and unavoidable in contemporary society: Just like Bee creates in art.

Bee has taught summer and honors camps, private lessons, in different school settings and at home when her kids were little. She creates art where ever she is. Brain storming counts.
